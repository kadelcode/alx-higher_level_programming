## Python - if, else, loops and functions
- *0-positive_or_negative.py*: 
  - A program for the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable _number_ is positive or negative.
  
- *1-last_digit.py*:
  - A program for the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable _number_
  - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable _number_ each time it is executed
  - The variable _number_ will store a different value every time you will run this program
  
- *2-print_alphabet.py*:
  - A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
  
- *3-print_alphabt.py*:
  - A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
  - Prints all the letters except _q_ and _e_
  
- *4-print_hexa.py*:
  - A program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
  
- *5-print_comb2.py*:
  - A program that prints numbers form _0_ to _99_
  
- *6-print_comb3.py*:
  - A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits
  - Numbers are separated by *,*, followed by a space
  - The two digits are different
  - 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits
  - Prints only the smallest combination of the two digits
  
- *7-islower.py*:
  - A function that checks for lowercase character
  
- *8-uppercase.py*:
  - A function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line
  
- *9-print_last_digit.py*:
  - A function that prints the last digit of a number
  
- *10-add.py*:
  - A function that adds two integers and returns the result
  
- *11-pow.py*:
  - A function that computes _a_ to the power of _b_ and return the value
  
- *12-fizzbuzz.py*:
  - A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separed by a space
    - For multiples of three it prints _Fizz_ instead of the number and for multiples of five it prints _Buzz_
    - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, _FizzBuzz_ is printed
    
- *13-insert_number.c*
  - A function that in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
  - *lists.h*
    - Header file for program *13-insert_number.c*
    
- *100-print_tebahpla.py*
  - A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (_z_ in lowercase and _Y_ in uppercase),not followed by a new line.
  
- *101-remove_char_at.py*
  - A function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position *n* (not the Python way, the "C array index")
